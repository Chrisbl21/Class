	<p>Nickelback gained global fame with their 2001 single "How You Remind Me," which topped charts in the U.S. and Canada and became one of the most successful rock songs of the decade. Their subsequent albums, such as Silver Side Up (2001), The Long Road (2003), and All the Right Reasons (2005), solidified their status as one of the most commercially successful rock bands, with hits like "Photograph," "Rockstar," and "Far Away." They have sold over 50 million albums worldwide. Despite their success, Nickelback has faced significant criticism and internet mockery, often being labeled as generic or formulaic. This backlash has paradoxically contributed to their notoriety, making them a cultural phenomenon discussed both for their music and the memes surrounding them. Regardless of public opinion, Nickelback's catchy tunes, relatable lyrics, and energetic live performances have earned them a dedicated fan base. In 2023, they were inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, cementing their legacy in rock music.
