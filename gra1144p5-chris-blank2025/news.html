		  Nickleback released a new music video
	  	</h1>
	  	<p>On January 31, 2025, Nickelback released a music video for their song "Tidal Wave" from their 2022 album Get Rollin'. The album marked a successful comeback for the band, debuting at No. 2 on several charts and achieving high rankings internationally. It is described as a melancholy rock-pop track with chiming guitars, exploring themes of a doomed romance. Interestingly, the song was not part of the original lineup for the album. After the album's completion, lead vocalist Chad Kroeger spontaneously created the song on an acoustic guitar, leading to a burst of creativity that prompted guitarist Ryan Peake to join him in developing it further. The duo spent hours refining the lyrics and themes, capturing what Kroeger described as an electrifying creative moment. </p>
